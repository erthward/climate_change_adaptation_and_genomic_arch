# NEXT STEPS

- why linkage say "[0.5, None]" instead of [0.5, 0.5], and is this a problem?
- debug KDE plot
- debug so that each iteration gets saved (rather than only 1 iteration from each scenario,PID combo!)
- finish writing up first pass analysis, then run and check out results, iterate back to setup

# OTHER
- calculate 2D phenotypic area occupied by the species b4 and after the shift event
- need to standardize y axes on histograms, pop-size plots, fitness plots?
- figure out why shift and null don't seem to be plotting together correctly
  on map and pop-size plots
