# NEXT STEPS:

## SIMS
- debug so that each iteration gets saved (rather than only 1 iteration from each scenario,PID combo!) (but not so important because I can just run a larger number of jobs to generate the full desired number of its)

- once everything is set, run full set of iterations, combine all output in one dir, then back up on BDrive


## ANALYSIS
- box plots of delta_Nt and delta_fit again

- should I run all sims longer, after climate change is complete, to show how long effects persist?

- decide if/how to run stats tests, then wrap all of that into the ch2_analys_job.sh script

- confer with Ian about final set of figs and all their details/tweaks

- once everything is set and full set of iterations are run, rerun analysis and back up full results on BDrive


## WRITING
- begin drafting: 
  - put all results into draft as figs
  - brainstorm bulleted list of all results of interest to be mentioned
  - then freewrite rough draft of results and of discussion following those bullets


## OTHER
- consider tweaks/expansions to analysis:
  - run sims without movement (and/or with movement and dispersal restricted so that it's on contour?), to compare and show relative importance of gene flow on adaptation?
  - run sims with effect sizes drawn from distributions, to show effect of that?
