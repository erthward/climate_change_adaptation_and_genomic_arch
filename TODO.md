# NEXT STEPS

- debug KDE plot
- debug so that each iteration gets saved (rather than only 1 iteration from each scenario,PID combo!)
- improve setup:
  - need to run a 'selective burn-in' phase, until populations and average fitnesses are stable --> otherwise, current pre-climate-change phase is not serving as a proper comparison because the population still is not in equilibrium
  - do something to constrain and/or measure the lateral spread of a pop (b/c see 100-gene sims, where pop is intially in a lateral band, then spreads east... that doesn't occur anywhere else... interesting result, or confounding of reuslts?)


# OTHER
- calculate 2D phenotypic area occupied by the species b4 and after the shift event
- need to standardize y axes on histograms, pop-size plots, fitness plots?
- figure out why shift and null don't seem to be plotting together correctly
  on map and pop-size plots
