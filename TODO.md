# NEXT STEPS

- come up with and run statistical tests on directional distributions from
  null vs non-null sims
- come up with metrics and tests of response time and demographic effect size
- calculate 2D phenotypic area occupied by the species b4 and after the shift event
- need to standardize y axes on histograms, pop-size plots, fitness plots?
- figure out why shift and null don't seem to be plotting together correctly
  on map and pop-size plots
